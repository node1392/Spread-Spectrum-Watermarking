# Spread Spectrum Watermarking (SS) - Code was based on the cox-watermarking repository

# Observation:
Spread Spectrum watermarking provides a higher level of strength against steganalysis compared to LSB method.
It’s robust against noise interference and because it’s spread over a high frequency
bandwidth it’s difficult to find the actual watermark. Placing the watermark in the most
significant part of the image increases its robustness. Also, different watermark strengths can be
used during to embed the watermark. If parts of the watermark are removed, enough information
remains to recover it.

Robust watermarking is designed to sustain any attack or signal processing
operation. Any attempts to remove the watermark will cause for the perceptual quality of the signal
to be destroyed. Robust watermarking is useful to prove ownership claims through copyright
protection.
